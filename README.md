# AR for Equality: Amplifying Social Impact Through AR Filters

## Project Overview
AR for Equality is an innovative platform that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) filters to raise awareness and funds for social causes. By combining crowdfunding with shareable AR experiences, we enable creators to build campaigns that spread meaningful messages across social media platforms.

## Key Features
- üåç Create AR Filter Campaigns
- üí∏ Crowdfunding with Polkadot Blockchain
- üîó Multi-Platform AR Filter Support (Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok)
- üåà Categories: Health, Education, Environment, Equality, and More

## SDG Impact
Our platform directly supports multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals:

- Goal 5: Gender Equality
- Goal 4: Quality Education
- Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
- Goal 13: Climate Action

## Technical Architecture
